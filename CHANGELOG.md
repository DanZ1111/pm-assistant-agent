# PM Product Tracker — Changelog

## v0.9.0 — Calendar + Admin Nav Hardening (Build 10)
_2026-05-23_

- New `/calendar` route showing planned vs. actually-launched projects by month
- Year navigation; click a month in the left list to view its project roster on the right
- "Planned" = projects with `planned_launch_date` in the selected month
- "Actually launched" = projects whose Launch phase is marked done with `actual_end_date` in the selected month (no schema change — derived from existing phase data)
- Each project row shows SKU, name, brand, status, planned date, actual date, and variance ("5 days late" / "on time")
- Calendar visible to all authenticated users (admin/pm/viewer) — only non-sensitive fields shown
- Verified Database and Users nav links are admin-only (lock-in test added to test_build8.py)

## v0.8.0 — Multi-Role Auth + Railway Deploy (Build 8 + 9)
_2026-05-22_

**Auth & Permissions (Build 8):**
- New `users`, `invite_pins`, `user_sessions` tables
- Login / logout / register routes with HTTP-only session cookies
- Three roles: admin, pm, viewer
- Admin can generate role-prefixed invite PINs (`PM-XXXXXX` / `VW-XXXXXX`)
- Field-level permissions: factory + engineer hidden from viewers (sidebar + change log)
- AI Permission Guard: viewers cannot extract sensitive fields via AI, no role can extract system internals (.env, API keys, model name)
- `/admin/users` page for user management
- `create_admin.py` bootstrap script with hidden password prompt
- Help/Ask AI now requires auth

**Railway Deploy (Build 9):**
- `app/database.py` now reads `DATABASE_URL` env var (PostgreSQL on Railway, SQLite locally)
- Auto-normalizes legacy `postgres://` URLs to `postgresql://`
- `run.py` honors `$PORT` and disables reload when `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` is set
- New `/healthz` endpoint for Railway healthchecks
- One-time admin bootstrap via `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` + `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars (idempotent, never overwrites existing admin)
- `railway.toml`, `runtime.txt`, `.env.example` added
- `psycopg2-binary` added to requirements.txt

## v0.6.0 — AI File/Image Intake (Build 6)
_2026-05-21_

- PDF extraction: text extracted via pypdf, fields parsed by GPT-5.4

- `project_files.ai_summary` populated from AI vision analysis
- OR divider between text paste and file upload on intake form

## v0.5.0 — AI Text Intake (Build 5)
_2026-05-21_

- New AI Intake page at `/ai/intake`
